  "cage_quotes": [
    "I am not a demon. I am a lizard, a shark, a heat-seeking panther. I want to be Bob Denver on acid playing the accordion.",
    "One of the things that's interesting to me is I find things like caffeine and stunts actually relax me. When they're putting a bit of gel on my arm and lighting me on fire, or when I'm about to go into a high-speed car chase or rev a motorcycle up pretty fast, I find everything else around me slows down.",
    "I was always shocked when I went to the doctor's office and they did my X-ray and didn't find that I had eight more ribs than I should have or that my blood was the color green.",
    "I think what makes people fascinating is conflict, it's drama, it's the human condition. Nobody wants to watch perfection.",
    "How do you rebel in a family of rebels? That's the age-old question. I guess I could have by not going into the arts, but the thing is, I couldn't do anything else.",
    "Every great story seems to begin with a snake.",
    "I think that 'Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance' was mentally taxing, if only because I had to go to a Christmas party shortly after I had wrapped photography in Romania at two in the morning as the Ghost Rider. The invitation had a Christmas ornament on it with Ghost Rider's face on it as a tree.",
    "Snakes are sometimes perceived as evil, but they are also perceived as medicine. If you look at an ambulance, there's the two snakes on the side of the ambulance. The caduceus, or the staff of Hermes, there's the two snakes going up it, which means that the venom can also be healing.",
    "I have dogs, and it's no secret that I find reptiles interesting, but the thing about reptiles is that they really just wanna be left alone, and I understand them. It's, 'Don't pick me up, stop holding me, don't look at me, just leave me alone.' I have to admit, sometimes I feel like that.",
    "When you start a movie, it's not like other kinds of work that you have when you know your boss for years or colleagues for years. You're meeting everyone, mostly, for the first time. You have to get comfortable with those people so you can perform, because the first thing that is going to shut you down is any kind of anxiety.",
    "How deep is hell?",
    "Whomever slays the most men drinks for free.",
    "You really think I let myself get killed in a garbage truck? Ha! Well I hid in a soup can. Rode it all the way to the city dump. And it was stinky.",
    "Of course, if there was any real dignity, there wouldn't be any sex.",
    "I call it... a hug. Because it rhymes with Grug; but you can always change it if you don't like it.",
    "Well, today's your lucky day, 'cause I brought an eagle.",
    "The caves won't save us! Nothing can!",
    "I'm gonna steal the Declaration of Independence!",
    "Bella bambina at two o'clock!",
    "We figured there was too much happiness here for just the two of us, so we figured the next logical step was to have us a critter.",
    "Pink underwear works. Pink underwear works.",
    "I picked two things I really like and put them together. Frankenstein and Cadillacs.",
    "You will tell me or I will eat your stinking soul!",
    "No man has spilled more blood in God's name than I. A benevolent God would not ask such things of men!",
    "Bangers and mash. Bubbles and squeak. Smoked eel pie.",
    "I have an acronym for myself. Know what it is? B.A.D. B.A.D... Balls, Attitude, Direction. You should give yourself an acronym... 'cause it helps you visualize your goals.",
    "HEY! My mama lives in a trailer!",
    "I ever hear about you so much as looking at that girl, you're gonna wish you were born without a dick.",
    "I never disrobe before gunplay.",
    "Well, Baby O, it's not exactly mai-tais and Yahtzee out here — but let's do it.",
    "He's scraping at the door. Scraping at the door! And if you don't tell what I wanna know, I'm gonna let him out.",
    "Everything I take is prescription — except for the heroin.",
    "Those toenails dry yet, sweetheart? We got some dancin' to do.",
    "I'll be taking these Huggies and whatever cash ya got.",
    "I ain't going back to jail. I'm tired. They didn't allow me to use silverware. I had to use my fingers. That's right, they didn't even allow me to use plastic spoons, forks, and knives! But I do hate the taste of metal in my mouth. That's why I refused to have braces.",
    "You're the lowest on the totem pole here, Alva. The lowest. Do you realize that? Every other secretary here has been here longer than you, Alva. Every one. And even if there was someone here who was here even one day longer than you, I still wouldn't ask that person to partake in such a miserable job as long as you were around. That's right, Alva. It's a horrible, horrible job; sifting through old contract after old contract. I couldn't think of a more horrible job if I wanted to. And you have to do it! You have to or I'll fire you. You understand? Do you? Good.",
    "I work in a little glass jar and lead a very uneventful life. I drive a Volvo, a beige one. But what I'm dealing with here is one of the most deadly substances the earth has ever known, so what say you cut me some friggin' slack?",
    "Kryptoniiiiiite! Go to Robiiiin's Reveeeeeeeenge!",
    "DON'T BE FRIGHTENED! I'm here to help!",
    "I don't believe I'll be having that beer just now. Not unless I'm drinking it from Jonah King's skull.",
    "This is fight night and IIIIII aaaaaaaam the kiiiiiiiing!",
    "BITCHES! YOU BITCHES!",
    "Man, I had a boner with a capital ‘O.'",
    "I wanna shake you naked and eat you alive.",
    "Y'know, I can eat a peach for hours.",
    "How could somebody MISFILE something? What could be easier? It's all alphabetical. You just PUT it IN the right file! According to ALPHABETICAL ORDER! You know – A, B, C, D, E, F, G!... H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P!... Q, R, S, T, U, V!... W, X, Y, Z! Huh? That's ALL you have to DO!",
    "Well, Peter Piper picked a pepper, I guess I did!",
    "I hope you don't mind: I partook of a few of your groovy painkillers. Oh, bravo. Bra-fucking-vo. Oh God, this is excellent. Bravo!",
    "Is this hers? How'd it get burned? How'd it get burned? HOW'D IT GET BURNED, HOW'D IT GET BURNED?",
    "What are these fuckin' iguanas doing on my coffee table?",
    "I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts! / Here they are, standing in a row! / Small ones, big ones, some as big as your head!",
    "I'm a vampire! I'm a vampire! I'm a vampire! I'm a vampire! I'm a vampire! I'm a vampire!",
    "You don't have a lucky crack pipe?",
    "What do you say we cut the CHITCHAT, A-HOLE?",
    "THIS IS MY MECCA! AHAHAHAHAHA! AHAHAHAHA!",
    "If I were to send you flowers where would I... no, wait, let me rephrase. If I were to let you suck my tongue, would you be grateful?",
    "You mean... my wang?",
    "Shoot him again... his soul's still dancing.",
    "Put... the bunny... back... in the box.",
    "OH, NO! NOT THE BEES! NOT THE BEES! AAAAAHHHHH! OH, THEY'RE IN MY EYES! MY EYES! AAAAHHHHH! AAAAAGGHHH!",
    "How, in the name of Zeus' butthole, did you get out of your cell?"
